His disappearance triggers a frantic search led by his mother, Joyce Byers, and Police Chief Jim Hopper. As the search unfolds, they encounter a girl with psychokinetic abilities named Eleven, who has escaped from a nearby government laboratory involved in secret experiments. Eleven becomes an integral part of the group as they work together to uncover the truth behind Will's abduction and the dark forces at play in Hawkins.
